One of the intersting things that I learned was that some people may even use Github when writing books. 
This is due to the both the user friendly interface that Github provides along with ability to organize multiple copies of a project.
I also thought it was really neat that it can be used by a vast group of people allowing for many to work on the common goal desired. 
There is a feature called a 'branch' that allows you to create a copy of the main code and have the ability to edit it without changing the original copy.
When the proper edits are made and the new code is running effectively and efficiently, that code can then replace the original main code.
This can be done by making a 'pull request', which asks the person in charge of the branch to review the code and permit the inclusion of the edited code made.
